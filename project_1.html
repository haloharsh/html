<p style="text-align: center;">I am Harsh Singh,
    I always wanted to be a youtuber as i watched so many people earning money,fame etc.
    so i created my first channel name "Gaming Monster".
    Yeah it sound silly i know but i think about the name for my first channel for hours then i came up with this.
    Unfortunately it got banned due to copyright strike as i was a kid so i didn't knew about such rules and my chennel got terminated i was sad really sad
    then i took break and again created a new channel (sry names are changed several times)
current is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@HaloHarshYT" target="_blank">"HaloHarsh"</a></p>
